# Helix Themes
- `dark+`: Inherits from the default `dark_plus` theme, but takes some inspiration from the JetBrains dark plus plugin.
- `rider_dark`: Inspired by the rider dark theme.
- `edge_aura`: Based on [this](https://github.com/CptPotato/helix-themes), but uses some different colors.
- `edge_transparent`: Inherits from `edge_aura` with the only difference being the transparent background and some color changes to make the theme work with the transparent background.
